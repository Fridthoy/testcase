# Data Transformation Project

## Overview
This project provides a configurable data transformation library implemented in Python. It reads transformation rules from a configuration file and applies them to a CSV dataset.

## Running Code and Test Suite
The code and test suite are available through the provided GitHub repository. You can clone the repository or download it.

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fridthoy/testcase.git
cd testcase
```


### Do the following steps: 
1. sownload python if not alredy on the computer
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python main.py


### deliverables
The code is created using python pandas. 
It does the transformations described in the task. 
it is created as a class so it can easly be used as an API and reused
a json file contains a script of the different transformations for easy editing
there are also loggings in case of any errors
